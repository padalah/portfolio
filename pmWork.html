					<h3>The Purpose</h3>
                    <p>
                        At Microsoft, I work on a Learning Engineering Team that develops Microsoft learning content and validation methods for learners. One of our 
                        main products enables learners to earn Certifications on a variety of topics and technologies. As a part of this product, our goals were to
                    <p>
						<ul>
							<li>Enable digital exam discounts for Microsoft learners (employees of partner companies, students, micrsoft employees, select event attendees, etc.)</li>
							<li>Enable learning and certification resources for people impacted by COVID-19</li>
                            <li>Increase certification rates through simplified exam discounts</li>											
						</ul>

					<h3>The Quest</h3>
                    <p>
                        Initially, this product was owned by another Microsoft team. After the product was transitioned to our team, I worked with
                        <ul>
                            <li>3 software engineers</li>
                            <li>1 user researcher</li>
                            <li>1 user designer</li>
                            <li>3 business program stakeholders</li>
                            <li>Support Team</li>
                            <li>Data Engineering Team</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>
                        We
                        <ul>
							<li>Identified our learners (employees of partner companies, students, micrsoft employees, select event attendees) through user research</li>
							<li>Collaborated with the programs that marketed learning content to our learners to develop a strategic vision for the Exam Discount Experience</li>	
                            <li>Designed and implemented a unified discount experience for our learners</li>
                            <li>Launched the experience to over a million active customers</li>										
						</ul>
                    </p>

					<h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        The inital discount experience has disparate processes for each "type of learner". Also, discounts were handed out manually through vouchers that did not provide an integrated
                        user experience or data collection.
                        
                        We understood a learner might have multiple identities. For example, let's take a learner named Alex. Alex works for Contoso, a Microsoft partner. She also attends Microsoft Events and she is pursuing her
                        graduate degree at Universtiy of Washington. Alex may be eligible for discounts thorugh her employer (Contoso), her school (University of Washington), or through
                        attending Microsoft events. Alex may have multiple online identities (emails, authentication processes) for each aspect of her life. Yet, Alex is Alex and she should be
                        able to receive ALL Microsoft learning discounts she is eligible for.

                        Using, common mental models such as linking accounts, email verification (if authentication of identity is not possible), we were able to design and 
                        a simple three step process to accessing discounts digitally. This work is also the foundation that is enabling us to expand the reach of Microsoft learning content discount to multiple audiences beyond those supported today.
